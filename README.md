# **GO Projects**
## **Started learning GO because**
- It is designed to run on multiple cores and has Built in concurrency mechanism

- It is very easy to implement unlike C++ and java

- Its use case is to make performance based application, running on scaled distributed systems.

- It is as easy as python and as fast as cpp, making it a good server-side language.
